##Why should one care about SEO?   

SEO stands for *Search Engine Optimization*, while business owners typically don't work on their own SEO strategy often-- there's clear benefits to a business investing in one.   
##Google Results   
Google has a [set of standards](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en) detailing what their SEO standards are. Simply put-- **Google will reward you for making a website the *right* way** by placing your website higher up on search results!   
Historically speaking, many businesses misused SEO standards with practices like keyword stuffing to make their website show up sooner in search results, even if their website wasn't truly relevant. For this reason Google and other search engines made stricter SEO standards to make it more difficult to abuse, the double edged sword of this is that now-- small businesses have less financial resources to develop a comprehensive SEO strategy.   
Here are some basic SEO tips to give you an idea of what an SEO strategy can entail:
##Thick and unique content
You are rewarded for being original and expansive in your content, break out that highschool essay trauma and get to typing.   
##Optimize your images   
Photos taken even on your smart phone might not seem very heavy in file size, but search engines really favor those who go the extra mile and make their page images as quick loading as possible. For this reason it's best to use tools such as [Compressor](https://compressor.io/) or to invest into website developer solutions that automatically optimize your images such as [Gatsby.js](http://gatsbyjs.org/).   
##Semantic HTML   
Not a coder? Don't worry, but make sure you're vetting your web developer solutions for their knowledge in semantic HTML. Essentially-- search engines favor websites that are highly accessible to assisted devices such as screen readers. If you have an agency, developer, or web building platform in mind-- go ahead and test their websites with [Google's analysis tool](https://web.dev/). The results of this tool will give you an idea of how accessible it is by measuring the site across modern accessibility web standards.

##In conclusion   
Does SEO still seem complicated? Well it is complicated, that's why their are professions entirely dedicated to SEO. But you don't need a second full time job-- you just need to be aware of what increasing your web presence really entails. With this knowledge, make sure you're only working with professionals who are well versed in SEO and only spending your money on solutions that keep this in mind.
